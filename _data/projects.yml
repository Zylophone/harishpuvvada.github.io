Extracted tweets using Twitter Rest API and processed them using Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy.Tested​ ​multiple​ ​algorithms​ for improving the prediction further optimized​ the performance using GridSearchCV​ to predetermine the optimal input parameters which increased the probability by almost 2%​."

- name:   Bitcoin price prediction using sentiment analysis on social media
  link: "http://www.github.com/harishpuvvada/BitCoin-Value-Predictor"
  description: "The project attempts to predict the future value of Bitcoins by identifying the correlation between social media sentiment and market sentiment. We will achieve this by collecting user feeds from social media such as twitter, facebook and linkedin. Once we have our corpus we will map their associated sentiments using IBM Watson’s Natural Language Understanding API. While mapping sentiments to our corpus we attempt to capture granular level categories namely joy, anger, happiness, etc. We use these as feature vectors to our ML/DL algorithms. Then we compare the results of the different algorithms and choose the one with the best accuracy score."
